# Banking-Insurance-Product-Phase-3

The department of Customer Services and New Products at Commercial Banking Corporation is seeking to predict which customers will 
buy a variable rate annuity product. In this phase of the process, we conducted variable analysis and modeling methodology. 
We were able to identify key attributes of potential customers and improve the ability of Commercial Banking Corporation 
to reach these customers. In particular, key customer attributes that indicate a higher likelihood of purchasing the 
variable rate annuity include:

• Higher balance in a certificate of deposit account
• Accounts in branches 14 or 15
• Higher number of checks written

Finally, our model can help Commercial Banking Corporation achieve a better return on marketing to potential customers. 
If Commercial Banking Corporation targeted the top 10% of customers determined by our model, we would expect twice as many purchases 
as compared to targeting a random sample of 10%.
